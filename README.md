#Personal laptop dotfiles depot

This is simply a repo I use for tracking the changes I make to my system dotfiles. I use stow to keep them in a syncthing backed folder and symlink them to the home folder. I will do my best to comment all the configs and leave them straightforward in case someone wants to replicate or borrow any bits that are useful.
